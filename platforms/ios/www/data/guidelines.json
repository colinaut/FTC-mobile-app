{"version":0.3,"guidelines":[{"title":"Alpha Thalassemia Major (ATM)","intro":"Alpha-Thalassemia is a hereditary blood disorder caused by mutations in the alpha chain of hemoglobin that can present along a range of severity. It is an autosomal recessive disease, resulting from DNA sequence deletions on chromosome 16; the most common is the Southeast Asian deletion (-SEA). Since there are 4 alleles coding for the alpha-globin protein, the disease can present as a spectrum. The homozygous form (-/-), often referred to as Hb Bart’s or Alpha-Thalassemia Major, results in the absence of all alpha-globin production. Unaffected chains accumulate and form tetramers that are unable to transport oxygen, ultimately leading to hypoxia and non-immune fetal hydrops. In utero transfusion of red blood cells can be life saving for fetuses with this disease.
