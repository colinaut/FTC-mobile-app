          "intro" : "Alpha thalassemia is an autosomal recessive blood disorder caused by mutations in the alpha chain of the hemoglobin structure. As there are four alleles coding for the alpha globin protein, the disease can present with a range of severity. The homozygous form (--/--), often referred to as Hb Bart’s or alpha thalassemia major (ATM), results in the absence of all alpha-globin production. In ATM, hemoglobin chains can accumulate and form tetramers that are unable to release oxygen, leading to hypoxia and non-immune hydrops fetalis. In utero transfusion of red blood cells can be life saving for fetuses with this diagnosis.  \r\rIn utero stem cell transplantation was developed as a strategy to address the challenges of postnatal management of this disease. These challenges include cost of serial blood transfusion, iron overload, toxic chelation therapy and, if stem cell transplantation is considered, finding a donor, conditioning for transplant and risks for graft vs host disease. In utero transplantation takes advantage of the fact that the mother and fetus tolerate each other’s cells during pregnancy by transplanting maternal stem cells into the fetus.\r\rWe have recently received the first FDA approval to perform in utero stem cell transplantation and we are now actively recruiting for a phase 1 clinical trial.",

One healthy kidney can support a normal life. \nSevere obstruction to both kidneys can be at the level of the bladder outlet (urethra), the bladder inlet (ureterovesical junction) or the kidney outlet (ureteropelvic junction). \nIf the obstruction prevents urine from draining  into the amniotic space around the fetus  oligohydramnios will occur leading to pulmonary hypoplasia.

She has led several large multi-institutional collaborative research projects to assess various aspects of imaging and associated outcomes, including several studies that have documented important drivers of medical imaging, ways to interpret imaging, and factors that help predict when imaging has the greatest impact. She has several ongoing studies that are focused on assessing and standardizing the radiation used for CT scanning, in order to minimize doses, without loss of diagnostic accuracy. She has several ongoing studies focused on improving the accuracy of interpretation of diagnostic ultrasound."

He completed general surgical and cardiothoracic and vascular surgical residencies in India and then came to the United States, where he served for a year as Chief Pediatric Heart Surgery Resident at Boston Children's Hospital. Dr. Reddy then went on to a clinical fellowship in pediatric cardiovascular surgery at Miami Children's Hospital and a combined clinical and research fellowship in pediatric cardiac surgery here at UCSF. After completing that fellowship, he was appointed to the Pediatric Cardiothoracic Surgery faculty and remained here until 2001.\nPrior to his return to UCSF, Dr. Reddy was Chief of Pediatric Cardiac Surgery at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital and Associate Professor of Cardiothoracic Surgery at the Stanford School of Medicine, where he performed pioneering, successful cardiac surgeries on premature and extremely low birth weight neonates previously thought to be inoperable. He brings a tremendous fund of knowledge, experience and innovation back to UCSF.\nDr. Reddy's research and clinical interests focus on complex neonatal repairs, including on premature and extremely low birth weight babies; fetal heart surgery; and cerebral protection during heart surgery.\nSince 2003, Dr. Reddy has been an active volunteer surgeon with Children's HeartLink, an international nonprofit that provides complex cardiac care to children in remote regions around the world, with yearly surgical clinics in India and China.\nDr. Reddy is a member of many professional societies, including the American Association for Thoracic Surgeons, the American Heart Association, and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons. He serves on the editorial boards of the journals Pediatric Cardiology and Cardiology in the Young and has published more than 150 peer-reviewed articles.\nResearch Overview\nSince 1993, Dr. Reddy has maintained a strong interest in research related to congenital heart disease. He has developed several fetal models for research. The fetal bypass models he developed have resulted in NIH grants for which he was the co-investigator (PI: Frank Hanley). His fetal shunt model resulted in multiple grants for which he was the co-investigator (PI: Jeffrey Fineman). Other models Dr. Reddy has developed, namely the fetal single ventricle model and the neonatal pulmonary arteriovenous model, have resulted in several important publications.\nCurrently, apart from the continuing fetal bypass project, Dr. Reddy is focusing on cerebral protection during neonatal cardiac surgery. This project has resulted in several publications and presentations and he is planning to apply for an NIH grant once the clinical data from an internally funded study is completed. Dr. Reddy has also investigated the use of extracellular matrix membrane for reconstructive purposes in congenital heart surgery, in an industry-funded study. With his return to UCSF, he is renewing his collaborative work on fetal circulatory models with Dr. Fineman."
