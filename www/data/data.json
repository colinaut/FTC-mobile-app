      {"title":"Alpha Thalassemia Major (ATM)","intro":"Alpha-Thalassemia is a hereditary blood disorder caused by mutations in the alpha chain of hemoglobin that can present along a range of severity. It is an autosomal recessive disease, resulting from DNA sequence deletions on chromosome 16; the most common is the Southeast Asian deletion (-SEA). Since there are 4 alleles coding for the alpha-globin protein, the disease can present as a spectrum. The homozygous form (-/-), often referred to as Hb Bart’s or Alpha-Thalassemia Major, results in the absence of all alpha-globin production. Unaffected chains accumulate and form tetramers that are unable to transport oxygen, ultimately leading to hypoxia and non-immune fetal hydrops. In utero transfusion of red blood cells can be life saving for fetuses with this disease.

One healthy kidney can support a normal life. \nSevere obstruction to both kidneys can be at the level of the bladder outlet (urethra), the bladder inlet (ureterovesical junction) or the kidney outlet (ureteropelvic junction). \nIf the obstruction prevents urine from draining  into the amniotic space around the fetus  oligohydramnios will occur leading to pulmonary hypoplasia.
